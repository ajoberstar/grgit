This sample shows how `grgit` can be used to interact with the 
repository the Gradle scripts belong to, by applying the plugin 
and using the `project.grgit` object.

To run the sample, using bash, 
````
  git clone http://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit grgit
  cd grgit/samples/jar-manifest
  ../../gradlew run
  ../../gradlew runJar
```
